Preprocessing

- High-variance filtering
- ComBat-seq (If the data is not continuous, better for raw RNA counts)
- Outlier detection (Using PCA or other methods)

Feature Extraction (Along with DEGs)

- RFE, XGBoost feature selection
- GSVA / ssGSEA pathway scores (For better biologicsl interpretation than raw gene values)
- Autoencoder latent features

Model Development

- Ensemble Approach

Stacking RF + XGB + AE + Transformer
Meta-model using Logistic Regression or LightGBM
Final probability = meta-model output


Evaluation
We can add MCC, Balanced Accuracy, Calibration (Brier score/ calibration curves/scores), DCA (Decision Curve Analysis)
